# Comprehensive AI/ML Knowledge Base

## Machine Learning Fundamentals

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. ML algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.

### Types of Machine Learning

#### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from input variables to output variables. The algorithm learns from input-output pairs to make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Examples:**
- Classification: Predicting categories (spam/not spam, image recognition)
- Regression: Predicting continuous values (house prices, stock prices)

**Common Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression: Models relationship between variables using a linear equation
- Decision Trees: Uses tree-like model of decisions and possible consequences
- Random Forest: Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Finds optimal boundary between classes
- Neural Networks: Networks of interconnected nodes mimicking brain neurons

#### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. It discovers structure in data where you don't know the desired output.

**Examples:**
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points (customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing number of features while preserving information
- Association Rules: Finding relationships between variables

**Common Algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering: Partitions data into k clusters
- Hierarchical Clustering: Creates tree of clusters
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensionality
- DBSCAN: Density-based clustering algorithm

#### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving feedback through rewards and penalties.

**Examples:**
- Game playing (Chess, Go, video games)
- Autonomous vehicles
- Recommendation systems
- Trading algorithms

**Key Concepts:**
- Agent: The learner or decision maker
- Environment: The world in which the agent operates
- Action: What the agent can do
- State: Current situation of the agent
- Reward: Feedback from the environment
